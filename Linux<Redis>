Perfect! WSL is now working! Now let's install Redis:

```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install Redis
sudo apt install redis-server -y

# Start Redis
sudo service redis-server start

# Test if it's working
redis-cli ping
```

If you see `PONG`, Redis is running! 

Now you can use the Redis code I shared earlier in your .NET project. Just make sure your connection string in `appsettings.json` is:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "Redis": "localhost:6379"
  }
}
```

And you're all set! Redis is now running on your Windows machine through WSL.

**Tip:** Every time you restart your computer, you'll need to start Redis again:
```bash
sudo service redis-server start
```

Or you can set it to auto-start:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable redis-server
```
